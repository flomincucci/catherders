Rules
=====

Cat Herders is a game for 2-players.

Components
=========

9 grumpy cat miniatures
15 blue Herders for player one and 15 red Herders for player two
The board, where the outer row of brown spaces is called the Wall and the green spaces inside are called the Park

Setup
=====

There are two different setups: the Beginner Setup, and the Standard Setup. Abstract game enthusiasts should head right to the standard setup up, but if you’re not accustomed to spatial strategy games or you’re playing with a kid, consider using the Beginner Setup.
Regardless of which setup you use, to complete the setup, place the nine cats on random empty Park spaces.

Turn Rules
==========

1. Players take turns. On your turn, you must either place a new Herder on any empty Wall space, or move a Herder already on the board 1 or 2 empty Park spaces in a straight line in any direction.

2. After you have placed or moved an Herder, you must move any cats which are now adjacent to that Herder, as follows:

3. A cat always moves to an empty Park space adjacent to it. It always moves to the adjacent space least surrounded by Herders (has fewest Herders adjacent to it). If there are multiple spaces with the same minimal number of herders adjacent to them, the moving player chooses which space the cat moves to. 

4. If, after moving a Herder, a cat adjacent to it has no empty adjacent spaces to move to, it stays where it is (but must move otherwise).

5. If multiple cats are to be moved, you may move them in any order you like (you can sometimes make it so that a cat doesn’t move at all, as in rule 4 above, by ordering their movements in a particular way).

6. Capturing cats: if at any time during your turn, a cat is adjacent to at least two of your Herders (regardless of how many of the opponent’s Herders are adjacent to it), remove it from the board and place it in front of you.

First player to capture 5 cats wins.

Variants
========

1. Try adding the following rule: For each cat you capture, you must remove one of the capturing Herders from the board (i.e. a Herder must escort each captured cat out of the park). This introduces a touch of negative feedback which could be necessary to balance the game at high level play (mind you I’ve no evidence it’s imbalanced – for structural reasons I won’t discuss, there’s a good chance it’s fairly balanced as is, but never hurts to have a backup plan, especially since I suspect the game may support high-level play).

2. For a longer, more involved game, require that a cat must be adjacent to at least three of your Herders to be captured, instead of two.

3. Another way to complicate the game in an interesting way is to have cats move two spaces each turn instead of one, following the cat movement rule described above for each step.

4. Try starting the game with no Herders on the wall at all.

5. You can also play the game on larger boards with more cats, and also on differently tile boards, for example a square grid.
